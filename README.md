# Techfest-Datathon---IIT-Bombay

## Problem Statement:
### Given the business potential of 3,915 regions over a period of 6 years(72 months), forecast the business potential of all these regions for the next 15 months. 
### Link to the detailed problem statement - https://techfest.org/2021/competitons/Datathon.pdf

## Approach and Workflow:
### Exploring the data:
#### Visualized data for different regions individually - Observed the presence of outliers, seasonality, trends, and noise.

#### Visualized data for 500 randomly selected regions in one plot - Observed that the data spanned a significant range, with the lowest plots near the origin, and the highest plots reaching the value of 50.
